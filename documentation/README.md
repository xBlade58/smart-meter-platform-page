# Documentation

The documentation is split into the following sections:
## [Coaching](./coaching/)

In the coaching section, the mandatory coaching sessions are documented. We have a file for each session containing a summary and the results of the session.

## [Implementation](./implementation/)

In the implementation section, we have folders per bigger component that contain additional information about these subjects.

## Who was responsible for what?

In this section, we want to document, who was responsible for what in the project. If we are talking about all three of us we mean Mert, Justin and Stefan.

### Documentation

The documentation was written by all three of us. We have created, the documents of our specific fields and reviewed and improved the documents together.

### Specification

The concept for the specification was created as a team through many discussions and also during the coaching sessions. Stefan took the lead in writing and coordinating the specification. Reviewing and improving the specification was done by all three of us.

### Sample Implementation

The sample implementation concept and design decisions were also made as a team by all three of us. The lead and work of implementing the concentrator and smart-meter service was done by Mert. The lead and work of implementing the home service and mobile application was done by Justin. The testing of the application in test scenarios and the real life application with the provided test station was also done by all three of us.
