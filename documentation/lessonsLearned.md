## Specification

- Naming is really important and crucial to define in the beginning
- big topic and normally not a thing one person could do in half a year
- complex because you need to consider manny sourrounding topics
- specifications have similarities e.g. the definition of the conformance levels
- everyone you talk to has a slghtly different opinion and wants to see their own concept in the specification, to support everyones needs and stay general enough is a big challenge
