TOOOOO Specific for energy?

## Features

### Third Party APIs and Standards

A connection to various applications working with external standards is important for a global acting system. Because of the broad availability of data, the cloud component is the part of the platform to implement these api's. 

A short incomplete list of standards:

**OpenADR (Open Automated Demand Response)**: OpenADR is a global standard for automated demand response, enabling utilities to communicate demand response signals directly to end consumers. Integrating with OpenADR mandates providing real-time energy demand data, enhancing grid stability and energy efficiency.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the system architecture it could be more interresting to place a OpenADR compliant component into the Iot Edge Device.

**Gaia-X**: Gaia-X is a European initiative promoting secure and trustworthy data sharing across diverse applications and organizations. Integration with Gaia-X necessitates providing relevant energy consumption and grid data, ensuring seamless collaboration within the European data ecosystem.

Standards may be implemented in the cloud system. If public APIs are implemented a well known standard should be followed.
