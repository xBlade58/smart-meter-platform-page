# Visualizing Application (App) Specification

## What is the Component About

The Visualizing Application, referred to as the "App," is a user interface component that connects to the IoT Edge device and the central cloud system. Its primary purpose is to provide users with a graphical representation of real-time and historical energy data, enabling them to monitor, analyze, and visualize their energy consumption patterns. 

## Input Parameters

- **Real-time Data from IoT Edge Device:** Includes current power consumption, injection, total consumption, and total injection, received via APIs from the IoT Edge device.
- **Historical Data from Cloud:** Provides access to historical energy usage data, including trends, patterns, and consumption summaries, retrieved from the central cloud system through APIs.

## Output Parameters

- **Visualizations and Graphs:** Real-time and historical energy consumption visualizations, such as line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts, to present data trends and comparisons.
- **User Interface Elements:** Interactive elements for users to customize visualizations, set preferences, and request specific data views.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Displays alerts and notifications to users based on predefined thresholds or anomalies detected in the energy data.

## Information Flow

- **From IoT Edge Device:**
  - Real-time data (power consumption, injection, total consumption, and total injection) received via APIs from the IoT Edge device.
- **From Central Cloud System:**
  - Historical energy data retrieved through APIs, including past consumption patterns, trends, and statistical summaries.
- **To Users:**
  - Real-time and historical energy visualizations presented in the App's user interface.
  - Alerts and notifications based on predefined conditions or user-configured thresholds.

## Features

### Privacy Concerns

- **User Data Anonymization:** Ensures that user-specific data remains anonymous and is not directly identifiable, preserving user privacy.
- **Consent-Based Data Sharing:** Implements mechanisms for users to provide consent for sharing specific data points or insights with third parties, ensuring data privacy compliance.

### Security Concerns

- **Secure APIs:** Utilizes secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for data exchange between the App, IoT Edge device, and central cloud system, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implements robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities and authorizes access based on user roles, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive features and data.
