# Open Meter Data Platform Overview

The **Open Meter Data Platform** is a solution designed to standardize a platform to collect smart meter data. This data can be used to optimize energy consumption and enhance efficiency in residential and commercial settings. Leveraging advanced technologies, this system offers real-time monitoring, data analysis, and visualization capabilities. 

## Requirements Notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Parts of the Specification

This specification is divided into a structure containing 4 parts. Each part has a specific role and a small introduction and overview section.

### [System Overview](1_SystemOverview/overview.md)

In this chapter the specification will give a small overview over the necessary components for building such a system. Specific implementations of the platform may differ from this recomendations.

### [Data Model](2_DataModel/overview.md)

In this section the data model is described. The Data Transmission Format was inspired by a project from the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration.

### [Communication](3_Communication/overview.md)

The communication from the SmartMeter to the Cloud is specified in this chapter.

### [Cloud Interfaces](4_CloudInterfaces/overview.md)

Which interfaces MUST be available and which of them are just RECOMMENDED is descibed in this chapter of the specification.
