# Cloud Component Specification

## Overview

The cloud component serves as the central hub in the smart meter system architecture. It acts as a layer above IoT devices, managing vast amounts of data, and facilitating seamless communication between various system elements. The cloud component is designed to handle several gigabytes of data per day and provides robust APIs for serving and querying data.

## Input Parameters

- **Meta Data per Smart Meter:** Metadata associated with each smart meter for identification and contextual information. Such as
    - type of household
    - number of people in the household
    - ??
- **Current Data from Smart Meters:** Real-time data from smart meters, including:
  - Current Power Consumption
  - Current Power Injection
  - Current Total Consumption
  - Current Total Injection

  -> TODO replace Injection and other Terms with more technical ones

## Output Parameters

The cloud component processes input data and provides the following output parameters:
- All input data from smart meters.
- Processed data from various algorithms and computations.
- Special queries results tailored to specific requirements.

## Information Flow

The information flow within the smart meter system involves five distinct types of data transmissions:

- **From IoT Devices to Cloud:** Data from smart meters is transmitted to the cloud component. Examples include raw power consumption data, meter metadata, and status information.
- **From Cloud to Visualizing Applications:** Processed and aggregated data is sent to visualization applications for user interfaces. Examples include real-time power consumption graphs, historical usage trends, and meter status updates.
- **From Visualizing Applications to Cloud:** User commands and queries from visualization applications are sent back to the cloud for processing. Examples include user requests for specific consumption data or setting preferences.
- **To Processing Application:** Relevant data can be queryed by specialized processing applications for in-depth analysis. Examples include data sets for machine learning algorithms or anomaly detection.
- **From Processing Application to Cloud:** Analytical results and insights from processing applications are sent back to the cloud for storage and further distribution. Examples include anomaly detection alerts or predictive maintenance suggestions.

## Features

### Privacy Concerns

To address privacy concerns, the cloud component ensures that sensitive customer data is anonymized and encrypted during transmission and storage. Access controls are implemented to restrict data access only to authorized personnel.

-> TODO how does the anonymization work?
-> Which critical data is collected about customers?

### Security Concerns

The cloud component employs robust security measures:
- **Secure Protocols:** Connections between the cloud component and other system elements are protected using industry-standard secure protocols, such as TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- **Authentication:** Strong authentication mechanisms are implemented to validate the identity of devices and users interacting with the cloud component.

### Data Analytics Module

The cloud component integrates a versatile Data Analytics Module, functioning as an abstract service. This module interacts with the system by:
- **Querying Data Through APIs:** Users and processing applications can query specific data sets using well-defined APIs, enabling tailored data retrieval.
- **Providing Results Through APIs:** Analytical results and insights generated by the Data Analytics Module are accessible through APIs, allowing seamless integration with visualization applications and processing units.

The cloud component offers flexibility, enabling the system to run in diverse environments. The specifics of data processing within the cloud are service-specific, allowing for customization based on unique requirements and analytical needs.
