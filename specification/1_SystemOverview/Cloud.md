# Cloud Component Specification

## Overview

The cloud component serves as the central data hub in the smart meter system architecture. It provides interfaces to query data and has a predefined way of storing data in the specified format.

## Components of the Cloud

The cloud consists of different components to consider.

### DataStorage

The cloud MUST be able to store the incoming data following the standards of the data model.

TODO - speed and data amount considerations

### Interfaces

The cloud component MUST implement the REQUIRED interfaces described in [4_CloudInterfaces](./../4_CloudInterfaces/overview.md). Additional interfaces MAY be provided by the cloud component.

### ProcessingComponents

A processing component is a component which processes data and is able to provide the results in a own way. This specification MUST NOT specify the functionalities of processing components.

## Privacy Concerns

**Anonymization and Data Minimization**
Privacy concerns are mitigated through stringent anonymization methods, preventing any association of collected data with individual users. The system adheres to data minimization principles, collecting only essential customer data defined for specific purposes.

**API Functionality and Purpose Limitation**
The API's operation is contingent on a substantial dataset from a predefined target group, aligning with purpose limitation guidelines. It functions solely with adequate, predefined data, ensuring its intended purpose while safeguarding user privacy.

**Data Retention and Anonymized Interfaces**
The system facilitates automatic data deletion after a defined period or upon customer request. Moreover, data exchanged at interfaces is strictly anonymized, adhering to IEEE standards. These measures collectively uphold robust privacy protocols and regulatory compliance.

## Security Concerns

The cloud component employs robust security measures:

- **Secure Protocols:** Connections between the cloud component and other system elements are protected using industry-standard secure protocols, such as TLS (Transport Layer Security).
- **Authentication:** Strong authentication mechanisms are implemented to validate the identity of devices and users interacting with the cloud component.

### Data Analytics Module

The cloud component integrates a versatile Data Analytics Module, functioning as an abstract service. This module interacts with the system by:

- **Querying Data Through APIs:** Users and processing applications can query specific data sets using well-defined APIs, enabling tailored data retrieval.
- **Providing Results Through APIs:** Analytical results and insights generated by the Data Analytics Module are accessible through APIs, allowing seamless integration with visualization applications and processing units.

The cloud component offers flexibility, enabling the system to run in diverse environments. The specifics of data processing within the cloud are service-specific, allowing for customization based on unique requirements and analytical needs.
