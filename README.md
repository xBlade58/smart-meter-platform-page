# Smart Meter Platform

The vision is to create a open platform to make data from smart meters private and publicly available.

## SMART Goal

Until **25th of Janurary 2024**, we will develop a specification for a Open Meter Data Platform, which shows ways to collect and visualises data originating from smart meters, whereby **every required interface** between data source and data sink in the cloud is **properly specified** in order for the **components** (IoT device, …) **to be interchangeable**, an example implementation following the standard should also be available for at least 2 components.

## Specification

In the specification, the platform is described in an abstract way.

[To the specification](specification/overview.md) 
## Concrete Documentation

In the concrete documentation the specific tecnologies are specified and the execution is documented.
