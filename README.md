# Smart Meter Platform

The vision is to create an open platform to make data from smart meters private and publicly available.

## SMART Goal

Until the **25th of January 2024**, we will develop a specification for a **Open Meter Data Platform**, which shows ways to collect data originating from smart meters, whereby **every required interface** between data source and data sink in the cloud is **properly specified** in order for the **components to be interchangeable**, an example implementation following the standard should also be available for at least two components.

## Concrete Documentation

In the concrete documentation the specific technologies are specified and the execution is documented.

[To the documentation](documentation/implementation/README.md)

## Specification

In the specification, the platform is described in an abstract way.

## Milestones

We are planning to reach the following milestones in our project in the specified amount of time.

The milestones we are planning to reach during this project are documented in the [github project](https://github.com/xBlade58/smart-meter-platform-page/milestones).
